# CS110L Spring 2020: Safety in Systems Programming

## Brief

In this course, I learned the magic language Rust.

If you've studied C and done some system programming, you've probably heard about C's memory leaks and pointer hazards, but C's underlying nature and efficiency still make it impossible to replace it in system-level programming with advanced languages such as Java that have built-in garbage collection mechanisms.Rust's goal is to build on the efficiency of C to compensate for its lack of security.As a result, Rust was designed with a lot of systems programming in mind.Learning Rust will also allow you to write more secure and elegant system-level code (such as operating systems, etc.) in C later.

The second half of this course focuses on the topic of concurrency. Students will systematically master several concurrency technologies, such as multi-process, multi-threading, event-driven concurrency, and compare their advantages and disadvantages in the second Project.The concept of "futures" in Rust is very interesting and elegant, and this basic knowledge is very helpful for my subsequent study of computer system-related courses.
